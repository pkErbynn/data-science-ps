you dont understand, u dont understand
what you do to me when you hold his hands
we were meant to be, but it was just a fate
made it, so we had to walk away

cause, we are on fire, we are on fire,
yeah, we are on fire, we are on now

i dont care what people say when we are together
you know i wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep
i just it be with u and i forever
i know you wanna leave, so come on 
baby be with me so happily
